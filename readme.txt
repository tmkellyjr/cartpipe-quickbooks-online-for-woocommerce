Cartpipe QuickBooks Online Integration for WooCommerce

== Description ==

Cartpipe QuickBooks Online Integration for WooCommerce is the easy-to-use, easy-to-configure QuickBooks Integration you've been looking for. 
Once installed, the plugin will:

*	Send WooCommerce customers to QuickBooks
*	Sync website prices with the values from QuickBooks
*	Sync website on-hand qty with QuickBooks (requires Standard or Premier)
*	Send orders from the website to QuickBooks as sales receipts or invoices (requires Standard or Premier)
*	Import items from QuickBooks into WooCommerce (requires Premier)
*	Export items from QuickBooks into WooCommerce (requires Premier)

Once setup, you can schedule the plugin to run on a schedule or manually. In order to connect WooCommerce with QuickBooks Online, you need a [Cartpipe account](https://www.cartpipe.com/services/quickbooks-online-integration/ "QuickBooks Online Integration for WooCommerce"). Cartpipe Basic is free and if you need extended functionality, you can sign-up for either our Standard or Premium Services


== Installation ==

Installation / configuration is straightforward. 

1. Install Cartpipe either via the plugin installing in your wordpress admin, or by uploading the files to your server and extracting.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Cartpipe > QuickBooks Online Settings
1. Enter your Cartpipe Consumer Key
1. Enter your Cartpipe Consumer Secret
1. Enter your Cartpipe License Key
1. Click the Activate button
1. From within your [Cartpipe.com account](https://www.cartpipe.com/account/ "Cartpipe Account"), click the Connect to QuickBooks button. This connects the plugin to your QuickBooks Online account

Once you've gone through those steps, the connection's been made. For product info syncing to occur, you just need to make sure that the WooCommerce sku matches the Item Name in QuickBooks. 
Customer's auto-map to QuickBooks and sending receipts just requires that you specify a few accounts to use in the pluging, otherwise, that's it.
